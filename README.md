We all love Blender's user interface that came with the 2.8 release. But if
you want to have all the gray UI tones just a tad darker, this theme is for
you.

## Installation

Inside Blender, go to `Edit` > `Preferences` > `Themes` and click `Install` in
the upper right corner. Choose the included xml file. You should now see a new
entry in the `Presets` dropdown.
